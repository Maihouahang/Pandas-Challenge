# Pandas-Challenge
This project is where I create and manipulate Pandas DataFrames to analyze school and standardized test data.
Data generated by Mockaroo, LLCLinks to an external site., (2022). Realistic Data Generator. Data for this dataset was generated by edX Boot Camps LLC, and is intended for educational purposes only.
